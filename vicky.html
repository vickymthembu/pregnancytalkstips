        <h2>Early Signs of Pregnancy</h2>
        <p>Many people notice signs of pregnancy early on, often before a missed period. Here are some common symptoms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> Increased progesterone levels can make you feel unusually tired.</li>
            <li><strong>Nausea:</strong> Often called morning sickness, this can occur at any time of the day.</li>
            <li><strong>Breast tenderness:</strong> Hormonal changes can lead to sensitivity and swelling.</li>
            <li><strong>Frequent urination:</strong> Increased blood flow to the kidneys can cause more frequent urination.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="stages">
        <h2>Stages of Pregnancy</h2>
        <p>Pregnancy is typically divided into three trimesters, each with its own developments and changes.</p>

        <h3>First Trimester (Weeks 1-12)</h3>
        <p>During the first trimester, the baby’s organs begin to develop, and many mothers experience nausea and fatigue. This stage is crucial for fetal development, and prenatal vitamins are highly recommended.</p>

        <h3>Second Trimester (Weeks 13-26)</h3>
        <p>The second trimester often brings relief from early symptoms and is marked by the baby's growth and movement. Expectant mothers may feel more energetic and begin to show a visible bump.</p>

        <h3>Third Trimester (Weeks 27-40)</h3>
        <p>The third trimester is focused on the baby’s final growth and preparation for birth. Mothers may experience discomfort due to the increased weight and size of the baby.</p>

    <section id="nutrition">
        <h2>Nutrition During Pregnancy</h2>
        <p>Proper nutrition is vital during pregnancy to support both the mother and the growing baby. Here are key nutritional guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Protein:</strong> Supports fetal growth and maternal health. Aim for lean meats, beans, and nuts.</li>
            <li><strong>Calcium:</strong> Crucial for the development of the baby's bones. Include dairy products or fortified alternatives.</li>
            <li><strong>Folic Acid:</strong> Prevents birth defects; leafy greens, beans, and supplements are excellent sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Iron:</strong> Supports increased blood volume. Red meat, spinach, and legumes are iron-rich foods.</li>
            <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Staying well-hydrated is essential. Drink at least eight glasses of water daily.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="prenatal-care">
        <h2>Importance of Prenatal Care</h2>
        <p>Regular prenatal check-ups are essential for monitoring the health of both the mother and the baby. Prenatal care helps detect any potential complications early on and provides support throughout the pregnancy. Typical prenatal visits include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ultrasounds to monitor fetal growth</li>
            <li>Blood tests to check for health markers</li>
            <li>Weight and blood pressure monitoring</li>
            <li>Guidance on nutrition, exercise, and overall health</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As the due date approaches, it’s helpful to prepare for labor and delivery. Consider these steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Birth Plan:</strong> Write a birth plan to communicate your preferences for labor and delivery.</li>
            <li><strong>Childbirth Classes:</strong> Taking classes can provide valuable insights into the birth process.</li>
            <li><strong>Hospital Bag:</strong> Pack essentials, such as clothing, toiletries, and baby supplies, in advance.</li>
            <li><strong>Support System:</strong> Ensure you have a support system in place for after birth, whether family, friends, or community resources.</li>
